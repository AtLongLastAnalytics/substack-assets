# File: .gitignore
# Description: Git ignore rules for the Terraform project. This prevents
#   sensitive or generated files (such as Terraform state, crash logs, and
#   environment variables) from being tracked by version control.
# =============================================================================

# Local .terraform directories
.terraform/

# .tfstate files
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*

# Crash log files
crash.log
crash.*.log

# Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sensitive data, such as
# password, private keys, and other secrets. These should not be part of version 
# control as they are data points which are potentially sensitive and subject 
# to change depending on the environment.
*.tfvars
*.tfvars.json

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf

# Ignore transient lock info files created by terraform apply
.terraform.lock.*

# Ignore CLI configuration files
