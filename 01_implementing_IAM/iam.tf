# Description: This Terraform configuration defines Azure AD groups for
#   Data Engineers and Data Analysts, and assigns appropriate role
#   permissions on Azure Storage resources.

# Azure AD group for Data Engineers
# Members: users who ingest raw data and create curated datasets

# Role assignment: Data Engineers - Storage Blob Data Contributor
# Scope: entire storage account (read/write access to all containers)

# Role assignment: Data Analysts â†’ Storage Blob Data Reader
